# Solar system

The Planet Information System is a simple Java application that models planets and their attributes, offering detailed information about each planet, such as its mass, volume, density, orbital and rotational periods, and classification based on mass. It also categorizes planets as gas giants, terrestrial planets, or dwarf planets using realistic thresholds.
The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts, such as enums, encapsulation, and class relationships, to simulate planetary data in a modular and reusable way.

# Features

- Planet Attributes:
Name, number of satellites, mass, volume, diameter, and distance from the sun.
Classification into Gas, Terrestrial, Dwarf, or Undefined based on mass.

- Planet Categorization:
Identifies whether a planet is an outer planet based on its distance from the sun.
Calculates the density of the planet dynamically.

- Realistic Data:
Uses real-world data for Mars and Jupiter as examples.

- Output:
Detailed, well-formatted output for each planet.
